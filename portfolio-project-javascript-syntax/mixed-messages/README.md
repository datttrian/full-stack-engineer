# Mixed Messages

## Overview

For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time
a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. You’re
welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an
astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To
make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be
made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know
of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to
your liking.

### Project Objectives:

- Build a message generator program using JavaScript
- Use Git version control
- Use command line
- Develop locally on your computer

### Prerequisites:

- JavaScript
- Git and GitHub
- Command line

## Setup

### Going off platform:

You will be doing this project outside of the Codecademy platform, on
your own computer.

For this particular project, you will be using your own text editor (we

## Resources

### Debugging Tips

Feeling stuck? Try the following:

- *Google your question:* oftentimes, someone has had the same question
  as you! Check out websites like StackOverflow and Dev.to to see how
  other folks have found solutions.
- *Read the documentation:* make sure to carefully read through the
  documentation for any languages and libraries that you are using.
  Oftentimes they’ll have examples of what you’re looking for!
- *Rubber ducking:* try to explain a problem to a friend or co-worker.
  Oftentimes you’ll figure out the solution as you’re trying to explain
  it. And if not, getting another pair of eyes on your code can be
  helpful.

vision.

## Project Tasks

Keep track of your progress by dragging each task from "To Do" to "In
Progress" to "Done" as you work on them. You can also click on a task to
see more information about it.

To Do


**Plan your project**

Visualize your end result. What is it built with? What can it do? Make
sure that it satisfies all of the project objectives.

Make a timeline for yourself and avoid the temptation to build things
that aren’t required. Setting firm boundaries and deadlines will keep
you on track and prevent scope creep.

The following tasks will help you identify natural break points.



**Come Up with a Topic**

Decide on what types of messages you want your program to output.



**Create script and run it locally**

On your computer, create a JavaScript file to write your code in. Make
sure you are able to run your script locally in Node.



**Set up version control**

Set up Git tracking in your directory and add and commit changes as you
make them.



**Store message components**

Decide how to store all of the message components for your game.



**Create the message**

Add functionality to randomly select the different message components so
they can create a cohesive message.



**Put the program together**

Combine the different parts of your program so the random messages are
selected, combined, and then displayed to the user each time they run
the program.



**Next Steps**

You’re welcome to expand your program beyond these project tasks and get
creative!
