# What is a Portfolio Project?

This project is a little different from other Codecademy projects you’ve
encountered. In this project, you will bring together what you have
learned in previous lessons to build a project in your own development
environment and publish it to the web!

# How Do Portfolio Projects Work?

We’ll provide you with high-level tasks to guide your project to
completion, but you will be responsible for deciding how to implement
them in your code.

There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these
requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and
other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily
solve.

Note that there are hints that can assist you, but they will only
provide one potential implementation. Do not worry if your program looks
different from ours!

# Project Prompt

## Portfolio Website

Portfolio websites are key to your career in web development–they let
you show off all the awesome projects that you’ve made and provide a way
for people to get in touch with you. This project will give you an
overview of how to make one for yourself.

# Portfolio Website

## Overview

### Portfolio Website

For this project, you will build a personal portfolio site, a static
website where you can share the projects that you build in this Path.
Typically, a portfolio website will have a main page that features
different projects that you’ve built and another page that contains
contact information, in case someone wants to reach out to you.
Occasionally, there are additional pages for each project, detailing the
technology used.

  class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
  target="_blank">Buy a custom domain name</a> and have it point to your
  GitHub Pages website

### Prerequisites:

- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- Git and GitHub

## Setup

### Going off platform:

You will be doing this project outside of the Codecademy platform, on
your own computer.

For this particular project, you will be using your own text editor (we
suggest <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">VSCode</a>) and Git version control. If
you need help setting up your text editor, read our

## Resources

### Debugging Tips + Helpful Resources

Feeling stuck? Try the following:

- *Google your question:* oftentimes, someone has had the same question
  as you! Check out websites like StackOverflow and Dev.to to see how
  other folks have found solutions.
- *Read the documentation:* make sure to carefully read through the
  documentation for any languages and libraries that you are using.
  Oftentimes they’ll have examples of what you’re looking for!
- *Rubber ducking:* try to explain a problem to a friend or co-worker.
  Oftentimes you’ll figure out the solution as you’re trying to explain
  it. And if not, getting another pair of eyes on your code can be
  helpful.

## Project Tasks

Keep track of your progress by dragging each task from “To Do” to “In
Progress” to “Done” as you work on them. You can also click on a task to
see more information about it.

To Do

**Plan your project**

Visualize your end result. What is it built with? What can it do? Make
sure that it satisfies all of the project objectives.

Make a timeline for yourself and avoid the temptation to build things
that aren’t required. Setting firm boundaries and deadlines will keep
you on track and prevent scope creep.

The following tasks will help you identify natural break points.

**Wireframe your website**

Using pencil and paper, or a wireframing software of your choice, draft
what you’d like your portfolio to look like.

**Create files and deploy it locally**

On your computer, create a directory to hold your files and create each
file. Deploy your code locally to see what it looks like in the browser.

**Version control**

Set up Git tracking in your directory and make sure to add and commit
changes as you make them.

**Build the Home Page**

The home page will be the main page that users visit. It should
prominently feature your name, along with a selection of several
projects that you are most proud of. Each project should have a picture,
a summary of the project, and the technology used to build it.

**Build the Contact Page**

The contact page includes your email address, as well as any other
relevant information such as your LinkedIn profile or a personal photo.

**Style the content**

Now that you have your content, consider how you would like it to look.
Do you want to arrange your projects in a grid? In an asymmetrical
arrangement? What colors do you want to use to personalize the page?

**Make it interactive**

Use JavaScript to add interactivity to your website.

**Make it responsive**

Use responsive design to ensure that your page is viewable on multiple
devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

**Publish to the web**

Take what you’ve built and use GitHub pages to share with the world.

**Next Steps**

Congratulations on building your own portfolio! You’re welcome to expand
your portfolio beyond these two pages. For example, you can include a
page for each project that you’ve built.
