# Welcome to the Full-Stack Engineer Path

See what you’ll learn in the Full-Stack Engineer Career Path.

Welcome to the Full-Stack Engineer Career Path! In this path, you will
encounter all of the major technologies that a full-stack developer
should know. You will gain a foundation in JavaScript programming, be
able to use front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, React, and build
secure back-ends with Node/Express and PostgreSQL. We’ll also make sure
to prepare you for the infamous technical interviews you’ll encounter
once you begin your job hunt.

### Learning Objectives

After this Path, you will be able to:

- Set up your own dev environment and version control your work with
  Git/GitHub
- Write client-side and server-side JavaScript code
- Create static, responsive websites with HTML/CSS
- Use the popular React front-end framework, along with Redux
- Build Node/Express back-ends
- Design and build PostgreSQL databases
- Connect a front-end to a back-end for a full-stack PERN application
- Implement best security practices to prevent attacks
- Pass a JavaScript whiteboard interview

### Syllabus Pages

We’ve created two types of syllabus pages to help guide you through this
journey. You’ve already navigated to this article from the first type:
The Career Path Syllabus.

class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp"
alt="screenshot of the landing page for the Career Path syllabus" />

You can use this Career Path Syllabus to see all the topics you’ll need
to know to become a full-stack engineer — or as a tracker for what
you’ve learned and will continue to learn. And from there, you can click
on one of the topics listed on the right to access the second type of
syllabus: the Unit Syllabus!

class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp"
alt="screenshot of the landing page for the first unit of the Career Path, &quot;Welcome to the Full-Stack Engineer Path&quot;." />

The Unit Syllabus is your go-to guide to your current *Unit*. Each Unit
is a major topic that we teach using smaller chunks of content, and each
Unit Syllabus contains expandable/collapsible lists of all of those
lessons, projects, and other content. For example, in our Fundamentals
of HTML Unit, we include a lesson on basic HTML syntax, and practice
content via a quiz and a project. We recommend looking at your current
Unit Syllabus before you start coding for the day.

### Projects

You will demonstrate your knowledge in several Portfolio Projects that
exist throughout the Path. Portfolio Projects are projects that you
build on your own computer, following a set of requirements. Each one
will be unique to your personal vision and set of interests. You can
complete the Portfolio Projects either in parallel with or after taking
the prerequisite content—it’s up to you!

Here’s a preview of the projects featured in this Path:

Mixed Messages

- Build a Node.js console app that generates random messages each time a
  user runs the program and version your project with Git/GitHub

Personal Portfolio Project

- Use HTML, CSS, and GitHub Pages to build a personal portfolio site, a
  static website where you can share your other projects <img
  src="https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/front-end-career-path/personal-portfolio-website/personal-portfolio-website-screenshot.png"
  class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp" alt="Portfolio website example" />

Reddit Client

- Use JavaScript, React, Redux, and the Reddit API, build an online
  forum containing real-life data <img
  src="https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/front-end-career-path/reddit-client/reddit-client-loading-slow.gif"
  class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp" alt="Reddit client example" />

E-Commerce Site (two parts)

- Over the course of two parts, build a full-stack web app where users
  can purchase products using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express,
  React, Node)

Open-Ended Project

- Use everything you’ve learned in the path to build an app of your
  choosing <img
  src="https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/front-end-career-path/open-ended-project/movie-database-screenshot.png"
  class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp" alt="Movie database web app" />

### Certification Exams

We’ve added exams to help you assess your proficiency as you build
toward job-ready skills. Here’s how they work:

- You’ll find exams on your Full-Stack career path syllabus page, at the
  end of each section.
- Each exam assesses your knowledge of the concepts and technologies
  learned in that section. Exams help verify your proficiency — so you
  can feel confident in your abilities as you build toward a new career.
- Each exam is 2 parts. The first is multiple choice and fill in the
  blank, and the second is coding questions, when applicable to the
  material. Otherwise, you will encounter additional multiple choice and
  fill in the blank questions.
- Score at least 70% on both parts of the exam to pass.
- If you don’t pass, no worries! You can retake exams once every 24
  hours.
- Taking or passing exams is not required to complete the path and exams
  do not factor into your progress percentage. However, exams must be
  completed and passed to earn your Codecademy Professional
  Certification. That means, you can now skip past content you are
  already familiar with and still earn a Codecademy Professional
  Certification.

### Curated Content

Throughout this path you may see some items that aren’t made by the
Codecademy team. We’ve included these to ensure that you learn all the
topics you need to get your career started. Though we didn’t write them,
we’ve vetted them ourselves for technical accuracy and good teaching
practices. When possible, we’ve written relevant assessments so that you
can check your understanding back on our platform.

### Updates

Since we strive to bring you the best and most up-to-date content, we
will be periodically updating the materials in this path. For smaller
updates we’ll be communicating changes via the
<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/articles/change-log-web-development"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank">Web Development Change Log</a>, which features updates
and bug fixes across all Web Development content. For larger changes,
we’ll write a <a href="https://news.codecademy.com/tag/updates/"

# Overview of the Internet

## Hello, Internet!

It is nearly impossible to overstate how much the internet has changed
how we consume information and communicate with one another. More than
four billion people around the world are internet users and the total
number of websites on the world wide web is nearing two billion.

Despite the presence of the internet in our lives, very few internet
users understand how it works. You don’t need to be an engineer to
benefit from understanding how the internet works. However,
understanding the internet’s infrastructure will help you decide if
learning web development is right for you.

In this lesson, you will learn how the internet works behind the scenes.
After finishing this lesson, you’ll be able to answer questions like:

- How is data sent from one computer to another?
- What is the relationship between a browser and a server?
- How is code turned into the experience that users see in their
  browsers?
- How has the web and web development changed from its invention to
  today?

By the end of this lesson, you will have the knowledge that you need to
collaborate more effectively with engineers and jump into your own
career in web development.

## The Ever-Expanding Network

So how did the internet start? In 1969, the United States Department of
Defense funded the creation of *ARPANET*, a precursor network to the
internet. ARPANET stands for Advanced Research Projects Agency Network.
ARPANET connected supercomputing centers run by government agencies and
universities.

These institutions wanted to connect their individual networks for
large-scale information transfer. However, many of them followed
different standards and technical implementations. In the 1970s, the
*transmission control protocol* and *internet protocol*, otherwise known
as TCP/IP, were created to provide standards around the transfer of data
that would allow these early networks to communicate with each other.

TCP/IP was researched and specified throughout the 1970s and adopted in
the early 1980s. As different networks adopted TCP/IP, the
interconnected global network of networks that is today known as the
internet was formed.

### Instructions

## The World Wide Web

While people today often use the terms internet and world wide web
interchangeably, they actually refer to quite different things.

*The internet* refers to the actual network of connected computing
devices. Although the internet was around in the 1980s, there was not an
intuitive way for most people to browse the internet. The internet just
sent messages produced by one computer and presented them to another
computer.

Engagement with the internet changed in 1989 when Tim Berners-Lee
invented the *world wide web*. The world wide web is a collection of
interlinked websites and other web resources. The world wide web, in
combination with the rise of web browsers in the 1990s, introduced a
user-friendly interface that enabled users to browse multimedia content
and interact with other users.

The invention of the world wide web led to the use of the internet in
wider society through the 1990s and the creation of a variety of
websites that are still in use today.

## Browsers and Servers

As we’ve seen, the internet is a network that links computer devices
worldwide, enabling people to share information with one another despite
vast distances. But how is information sent from one device to another?

One way of understanding this process is to look at the *client-server*
model. In this model, the *client* refers to the user’s device or
program that is making a request for data. A client can be a browser or
application running on a user’s laptop, smartphone, or tablet.

The *server* is the device or program in that network that waits for
incoming requests and sends back data. This might be an in-house server,
a rented server at a data center, or cloud server. At Codecademy, we
have servers that store lesson data and our servers are sending this
lesson data to your client device.

### Instructions

Watch the video to learn about the importance of browsers and servers,
then move to the next exercise when you are ready to proceed.

### Solution

[What is a server?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ8NzLGMrSA&t=1s)

## 404 Status Code

Let’s take a deeper dive into the client-server model through exploring
a part of HTTP that you’ve probably seen before: *HTTP status codes*.

When a server responds to a client, the server specifies a status code
as a part of the response. Status codes indicate whether or not the HTTP
request was successfully completed and if there was an error, they
contain some information about the type of error that happened. The
status code helps the browser know how to handle the data that was sent
back with the response.

Review the HTTP statuses below and see if any of them seem familiar.

<img
src="https://content.codecademy.com/programs/code-foundations-path/web-dev-survey/table.svg"
class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp"
alt="a table showing the most common HTTP status codes" />

### Instructions

1.  The browser is currently displaying a website that Alex has created
    to show photos and descriptions of her pets. If you click on the
    links for `Dogs` or `Cats`, you can see more information about
    Alex’s dogs and cats.

2.  Next, click on the file icon in the upper left corner of the text
    editor. You’ll see the different HTML files that the server is ready
    to send to the browser whenever those links are clicked. These HTML
    files correspond to the different web pages that are displayed in
    the browser. When the `Dogs` link is clicked, the server will send
    the `dogs.html` file to the client.

3.  Try out the `Dogs` and `Cats` links now!

4.  Let’s create a 404 status response by making a request for a
    non-existent resource. Alex hasn’t built a webpage to list her
    turtles! Click on the link for `Turtles` to see the browser display
    the 404 status code.

### Solution

``` html
<body>
  <img src='https://content.codecademy.com/programs/code-foundations-path/web-dev-survey/pets.jpg' width='400px'/>
  <p>Hi, I'm Alex. Welcome to my website dedicated to my pets! They are the cutest buckets of joy you'll ever lay your eyes on! Check them out here:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="dogs.html">Dogs</a></li>
    <li><a href="cats.html">Cats</a></li>
    <li><a href="turtles.html">Turtles</a></li>
  </ul>
</body>
```

## How Do Browsers Work?

So far we’ve seen how a single request and response are handled between
a client and a server. But most of the time, our devices aren’t making a
single request. Every time we load a webpage, our device sends a request
for each file that makes up that page. So even when we’re just loading
*one* webpage, that page can make multiple requests in order to retrieve
different pieces of content, like images.

So how does this process work when we’re making multiple requests
simultaneously?

All of the following steps happen in a split second:

1.  When a user types in a URL and presses enter, the server processes
    the request and sends the HTML file back to the client. *HTML* files
    hold the content of a website and they also contain links for any
    additional assets or code that are needed to display the site
    properly.
2.  The browser will begin to search for elements in the HTML file and
    it will start to make additional HTTP requests for any other
    external resources used by the HTML file. This often includes:

- One or more CSS stylesheets. *CSS* stands for cascading style sheets;
  CSS creates the style and layout of a web page. The browser will
  request the CSS stylesheet, and when the server sends it back, the
  browser analyzes the CSS and starts applying the visual styles to the
  content of the site.  
- The request-response cycle also sends website assets, like images and
  videos, from the server to the browser. If these files are large,
  there might even be a noticeable delay before they are rendered by the
  browser.  
- One or more JavaScript files. *JavaScript* makes the webpage
  interactive. This programming language functions as the “behavior” of
  the web page. A webpage that does not use JavaScript is known as a
  *static* webpage.

In most modern browsers, these additional requests are made in parallel.
This means that these requests are initiated at the same time, and the
browser does not wait to receive one resource before requesting the next
resource.

All of the resources are typically displayed as soon as possible. The
HTML will be displayed even if some of the other assets have not been
received by the browser.

Voila! The user can now interact with the website that they requested to
see. This whole process typically happens in about a second or less,
depending on the speed of the user’s connection, the size of the
website, and even the physical distance between the browser and the
server.

### Instructions

The animation to the right shows the different languages that work
together to display a webpage. When you’re ready, move on to the next
exercise.

## Web 2.0

Now that we’ve covered some of the basics of how the internet works,
let’s check out some trends that are fundamental to the emergence of
modern web development and modern JavaScript.

The earliest static websites were composed of text, images, and links,
with very little interactivity beyond browsing from one page to another.
These websites are called *static*, which means lacking in movement
because they do not change based on user behavior. As internet
connection speeds and web technologies progressed, more complex
interactions became possible on the web.

A collection of advances in the early 2000s created a cluster of web
applications that are often called “Web 2.0”. In comparison to early
static websites, Web 2.0 applications are often defined by:

- Providing a dynamic user experience by offering content that responds
  to user input without forcing the page to reload. In the early web,
  user input would typically take the user to a new page — and they
  would have to wait for the new page to load. In Web 2.0, websites
  could just update selected regions of the page, avoiding the
  interruption caused by reloading.
- Emphasizing user-generated content and social sharing. In the early
  web, content was generally authored by a single source. The rise of
  blogging, social media, and wikis in web 2.0 meant that users could
  generate content and share it with their friends.

There were important technical advances that enabled each of these
advances in the user interface of the internet. For example:

- *jQuery* was the first JavaScript framework that could fetch data
  while the web page is running.
- The rise of *web frameworks* that connected to databases, like Spring,
  Django, and Ruby-on-Rails, enabled user-generated content to
  effectively be created, stored, and displayed.

### Instructions

What are the differences between Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 pages? The answers
are in these screenshots.

On the left, the Web 1.0 page is *static:* it does not respond to user
behavior and the content is the same for all users.

On the right, the Web 2.0 page is:

- Interactive — you can Like and Comment on the page
- Dynamic — the time since posting (currently “12 hrs”) updates without
  reloading the whole page
- Allows social interaction — a lot of friends liked this image!

## Current Internet Trends

The rise of internet-connected smartphones has profoundly changed how
users interact with the internet. Mobile internet traffic now accounts
for more than half of all internet traffic and web development practices
have evolved in order to provide a good user experience regardless of
device type.

#### Responsive Web Design

The rise of *responsive web design* has changed how websites are built.
Responsive web design was enabled by additions to the CSS language, like
media queries and relative units. These additions allow the presentation
of websites to adjust based on the size of the window in which they are
displayed.

#### Mobile Applications and Devices

The rise of internet-connected *mobile applications* has changed the way
that we think about browsing the internet. Users accessing the internet
on smartphones are likely to spend much more time with specific
applications, rather than using their phone’s browser.

Though most mobile applications are internet connected, they are not
part of the world wide web. The web is built out of links, whereas
mobile applications are designed to keep the user’s attention.

If you want to learn about mobile development, web development is a
great place to start! While the majority of mobile applications are
built in programming languages, like Swift for iOS, it is increasingly
common to see developers using JavaScript frameworks to build new apps.

### Instructions

Check out the basic responsive website shown here. Try resizing the
screen—you’ll notice the font size adjusting as the screen width
changes.

Move to the next exercise when you’re ready to proceed.

### Solution

``` html
```

## Review

Congratulations! You should now have a general understanding of how the
internet works, including:

- The growth of the internet as a network
- The difference between the internet and the world wide web
- The relationship between browsers and servers
- HTTP status codes, like 404 Not Found
- Big trends in web development, from static websites to Web 2.0 and the
  rise of mobile

If you work with engineers, this information will help you talk about
websites and web applications at a more technical level. Or if you’re
interested in becoming a web developer yourself, you now have the
important context to start building your own website or web application!

# Languages for Web Development

## What is Web Development

Welcome to the world of web development! Millions of users have learned
to make websites and web applications on Codecademy — and you could be
next.

Having web development skills allows you to take your big ideas —
whether it’s a simple website, a complex web application, or even a
browser game — and build them on the web!

Meet Alejandra! She is a budding web developer. She runs a small travel
agency. Alejandra finds her customers mostly through word of mouth, but
now she’s ready to expand her business by building a website.

In this lesson, we will follow Alejandra along her journey to learn new
languages for web development, and we will see what kinds of features
each new skill allows Alejandra to build for her site.

The four main languages that Alejandra needs to learn include:

- **HTML** — structures website content
- **CSS** — applies styling to websites
- **JavaScript** — adds interactivity to websites
- **SQL** — allows your web application to store and retrieve data

We’ll follow along with Alejandra as she picks up each of these
languages, starting with HTML.

### Instructions

Continue to the next exercise when you are ready to dive into HTML!

### Solution

## What is HTML

Alejandra knows that the first step to building a website is learning
HTML. Why? *HTML* is the skeleton of all web pages. It provides
structure to the content on a website, including text, images, buttons,
videos, and more.

HTML is a practical place to start learning to code. You can build basic
websites after learning just a little HTML, with text, images, and
videos. You can always open up your work-in-progress website with your
browser and see what you’re building.

HTML stands for **h**ypertext **m**arkup **l**anguage. In the next few
exercises, we will look at the HTML acronym word-by-word to unpack what
HTML really means.

### Instructions

Take a peek at the HTML code to the right. Some parts of the language
are pretty intuitive, see if you can figure out how anything works.

If not, don’t worry! We’ll explain it soon.

### Solution

``` html
<h1>Why learn HTML?</h1>

<p>HTML provides the skeleton for websites, and it is a great place to start when learning to code!</p>

<img src="https://content.codecademy.com/programs/code-foundations-path/web-dev-survey/programming.jpeg" alt="" height="100" width="100">

<p>HTML is used by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Web developers</li>
  <li>Marketers</li>
  <li>Content creators</li>
  <li>Entrepreneurs</li>
  <li>and many more!</li>
</ul>
```

## HTML Markup

The *ML* in HTML stands for *markup language*. Markup refers to a way of
annotating text that is distinguishable from the text itself. The same
way that a teacher might “markup” a student essay by underlining topic
sentences and circling spelling errors, HTML annotates the content
within a web page.

A teacher might use a red pen to make sure that their comments are easy
to distinguish from the student’s own work. HTML separates content and
annotation by using HTML tags, which are denoted by angle brackets (also
known as less-than and greater-than signs).

### Instructions

Compare the markup for the essay to the markup in the HTML diagram. How
do they compare?

### Solution

<img src="https://content.codecademy.com/programs/code-foundations-path/html%20annotation.svg" alt="An example of HTML code for a website side by side with an imagined autobiography page, demonstrating the similarities in structure." class="gamut-1h2re45-imageStyles-imageStyles e1xtjyf0">

## HTML Elements

HTML tags are the “markup” for HTML. They are annotations that provide
information about the type of content they contain. Let’s take a close
look at the syntax for how HTML tags surround content to create an HTML
element.

The diagram displays an HTML paragraph element. As we can see, the
paragraph element is made up of one opening tag (`<p>`), the content
(“Hello World!” text), and a closing tag (`</p>`).

Let’s quickly review each part of the element pictured:

- HTML element — a unit of content in an HTML document formed by HTML
  tags and the text or media it contains.
- Opening Tag — the element name used to start an HTML element. The tag
  type is surrounded by opening and closing angle brackets.
- Content — The information (text or other elements) contained between
  the opening and closing tags of an HTML element.
- Closing tag — the second HTML tag used to end an HTML element. Closing
  tags have a forward slash (/) inside of them, directly after the left
  angle bracket.

### Instructions

Study the diagram to the right to learn about the anatomy of HTML
syntax. When you’re done, continue to the next exercise.

## Common Tags

Okay, let’s practice using HTML elements by writing a few different
tags.

Here are a few common tags that you can start getting familiar with:

``` html
<h1>This is a heading, it emphasizes text.</h1>
 
<p>This is a paragraph, it is the most common tag for larger chunks of text.</p>
 
<a>This is an anchor tag, used to specify the text that is the "anchor" for a link.</a>
 
<button>This is a button.</button>
```

### Instructions

**1.**

Let’s make the heading stand out! Put an opening and closing `h1` tag
around the text that says `Jetsetter Travel Agency`.

**2.**

Put an opening and closing `p` tag around the long paragraph that starts
with `With over 25 years...`.

**3.**

Put an opening and closing `button` tag around the text that says
`Click here!`.

### Solution

``` html
<h1>Jetsetter Travel Agency</h1>
<p>With over 25 years of experience in concierge, high-end travel planning, we'll provide you with the highest quality services. Every vacation is unique, custom, and tailored to your tastes.</p>
<button>Click here!</button>
```

## Hypertext and the World Wide Web

The H and T in HTML stands for **h**yper**t**ext. Hypertext is text that
is linked to other text. This diagram shows different websites that are
connected to each other through links, which are represented by arrows.

What’s so hyper about hypertext? The prefix *hyper* indicates that the
text expands beyond the traditional constraints of the written word.
Instead of reading documents from beginning to end, like you would read
a book, someone going through hypertext can *browse*. By clicking on
links from one document to another, the user can navigate to whatever
page they find the most interesting and carve their own unique path
through the web.

Many modern websites provide rich user experiences, with features like
embedded videos, animations, and interactivity, so it doesn’t
necessarily feel like you are just navigating from one HTML page to the
next. But despite all of the advances that have taken place with the
growth of the web, at its core the web is still just a collection of
hyperlinked documents.

### Instructions

Review the structure of links shown in the diagram, then continue to the
next exercise when you are ready.

### Solution

<img src="https://content.codecademy.com/programs/code-foundations-path/web-dev-survey/hypertext_diagram.svg" alt="A series of webpage like images showing links from one to another." class="gamut-1h2re45-imageStyles-imageStyles e1xtjyf0">

## Adding Hyperlinks

Let’s explore how hypertext works by adding a link to a basic website!

Reading and modifying code is an essential first step in learning to
build things for the web. This practice can take you a long way while
you’re learning to build websites from scratch.

An *attribute* in HTML provides additional information about an HTML
element. It comes in a name and value pair with the structure
`name="value"`. For example, you can specify the width of an HTML
element with the attribute `width="500"`.

Links are created in HTML with something called the `href` attribute,
which stands for **h**yperlink **ref**erence. The `href` attribute
allows us to specify the URL, or address on the web, that a link should
take users to. See below for an example of the `href` attribute in
action.

When we set the `href` property on an anchor tag (abbreviated to `<a>`)
we can specify both the text that should be rendered for the user (the
text within the anchor tag) and the URL that the browser should navigate
to.

With this code, we’re assigning the value `www.codecademy.com` to the
`href` attribute. When a user clicks on the text of this link (Learn to
code!), they will be directed to <a href="http://www.codecademy.com"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.codecademy.com</a>.

``` html
<a href="www.codecademy.com">Learn to code!</a>
```

### Instructions

**1.**

Alejandra has begun to build out her business’s website. She wants to
link from her homepage to a different page that contains her resume.

To start, look in **index.html** for the text that says
`25 years of experience` — it should be near line 20. Put an anchor tag
(`<a>`) around this text.

**2.**

Add a `href` attribute to this anchor tag, and give it the value
`/resume.html`.

This URL is called a *relative path* and it looks a little different
from the full URLs you’re used to seeing. That’s because it’s actually a
link to another page on the same website, so we can omit the first part.
Instead of `www.jetsetter.com/resume.html` we can abbreviate the link to
just `/resume.html`.

Open the hint if you need a reminder on how to set attributes for html
tags.

**3.**

Click on the link that you just made to navigate to see Alejandra’s
resume!

Click **Run** one more time when you are ready to move on to the next
lesson.

## What is CSS?

Using just HTML, Alejandra was able to build a website that contains all
of the content that she wants. But it doesn’t look very
impressive—Alejandra knows that a basic black and white website won’t
give her business the credibility she needs to find new customers.

That’s where CSS comes in! *CSS* is the language that provides *style*
to the content of an HTML page. This includes colors, fonts,
positioning, layout, and more!

Why do we need a separate language for content and presentation? This is
an example of the computer science principle *separation of concerns*.
Large codebases are kept maintainable when each section has clearly
differentiated problems that it is trying to solve.

Since the styling rules are described separately from the content
itself, if Alejandra adds more paragraphs, images, or other forms of
content, she can expect them to be styled the same way as her existing
content. This will save Alejandra time in the long run, especially as
her website gets more and more complex.

### Instructions

After you’ve reviewed the diagram to compare the uses of HTML and CSS,
continue to the next exercise.

### Solution

<img src="https://content.codecademy.com/programs/code-foundations-path/web-dev-survey/House-Blue-Print-Diagram.svg" class="gamut-1h2re45-imageStyles-imageStyles e1xtjyf0">

## Applying CSS

Alejandra has learned CSS and created the desired visual rules to make
her website look sleek and polished.

Navigate to the **style.css** file to take a look at the CSS code that
she’s written.

In this file, you will recognize many of the HTML tags that you have
been working with — and maybe a few that you haven’t seen yet! CSS
contains *selectors* that specify the HTML elements to which the style
should be applied as well as *visual rules* that specify how that
content should be displayed.

Now it’s time to use the HTML link element to apply the CSS file to her
existing website. This is done with an HTML link tag. An HTML link tag
is often used to create a connection between an HTML file and the CSS
file and tells the browser to apply the CSS styles to the HTML.

### Instructions

**1.**

On line 6 of **index.html**, copy and paste the code below to apply the
CSS file to the existing HTML.

Use your knowledge of HTML attributes to figure out what this code
specifies, and check out extra information in the hint if you want to
learn more.

``` html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
```

**2.**

Awesome! Alejandra’s site is looking good! Just a little CSS can make
the difference between a website that looks like a skeleton and
portfolio-ready site.

Now let’s tweak the CSS just a little bit, to see how the visual rules
specified in CSS can change the way that a website is displayed.

Navigate to the **style.css** and scroll down to line 37 where you will
see the `h1` selector. This section defines the styles for the `h1`
element on the page, which is the most prominent heading.

Just for practice, change the `color` property from `white` to `black`
and press Run to see what changes!

**3.**

Good job changing the color of the `h1` text!

If you look at the rendered browser, you’ll notice that the heading text
is no longer readable in-front of the image.

Let’s change the color property within the `h1` selector back to white.

## What is JavaScript?

Now that Alejandra has her website looking polished, she’s realized that
she wants the site to be more interactive. She would like to build a
shopping cart feature that allows her users to buy travel packages
directly from her website.

To accomplish this, Alejandra is going to need to learn JavaScript. Any
website that provides more than just static information probably
utilizes JavaScript in some way. Here are some familiar examples of
website features most often built with JavaScript:

- popup ads
- animated graphics (2D or 3D)
- interactive audio and video
- maps and other features access the user’s geographic location
- and much more!

One of the defining features of JavaScript is its ability to respond to
browser events. These events happen in real time and can be triggered by
a wide variety of user interactions, including:

- the user clicking on a button
- the user pressing enter on their keyboard
- a video file finishing loading
- the user re-sizing their window
- the user hovering over text on the webpage

### Instructions

**1.**

One of the classic browser events that JavaScript can respond to is the
position of the mouse. When a user puts the mouse near an HTML element,
the `onmouseover` event is fired.

Hover over the text in the browser to see how it responds to the
`onmouseover` event.

Once you have observed the effect of `onmouseover`, click the **Run**
button to move on to the next Checkpoint.

**2.**

What else is happening here?

JavaScript uses functions, which are reusable blocks of code designed to
perform a specific task.

`drawText` is a function that is being run on line 2. Change the text
that says `'hello world'` to `'JavaScript'` to pass a different value
into this function.

Check out the browser to see what changed! One of the benefits of
functions is that they are *reusable*. The `drawText` function allows us
to take advantage of the reusability of functions because it can render
any input text without us needing to rewrite the logic of the function.

Confused? Don’t worry, we’ll cover functions more thoroughly in the next
exercise.

### Solution

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="alphabet.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <canvas id="myCanvas"></canvas>

    <script type="text/javascript" src="bubbles.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="index.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

``` js
// Change the text between the quotation marks and run your code to see the name of your favorite language animated!
drawText('JavaScript');

// The code below will allow you to interact with the letters
bounceBubbles();
```

## JavaScript Functions

In the last exercise, you started to think about two key building blocks
of JavaScript: functions and events. Let’s review:

- Functions allow us to write a chunk of code once that can be reused
  over and over.
- Events allow JavaScript to respond to user behaviors, like the user
  hovering their mouse over an HTML element or resizing their window.

Events and functions combine to give JavaScript the ability to create
interactive experiences. When an event is fired, a function is executed.
This pattern is used again and again in web development to create
interactive websites.

First, let’s take a look at the JavaScript in the **index.html** file.

The JavaScript code is between the `<script>` tags. This tag alerts the
browser that the page contains JavaScript and separates the JavaScript
code from the HTML.

Find the JavaScript function `changeColor()`. This function chooses a
color from a list of colors.

How does that happen?

First, the `getRandomColor()` function generates a random series of
numbers and letters to create a new
<a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/hexadecimal-decimal-colors.html"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">hexadecimal color code</a>.

It then saves the new color under the name `newColor`.

``` js
let newColor = getRandomColor();
```

On the next line, the `document` keyword accesses the page’s background
color and sets it equal to the new color.

``` js
document.body.style.backgroundColor = newColor;
```

Click the **Run** button to move on to the next checkpoint to see how we
can let a user change the color!

**2.**

The next step is to connect the `changeColor()` JavaScript function with
an event, so that when we click the `Repaint!` button, it changes the
background color.

An event is something that can happen in a browser, like clicking or
hovering with your mouse.

HTML attributes can set events, where the **name** of the attribute is
the event and the **value** of the attribute is the JavaScript function
that we want to execute.

In this case, the name of the event is `onclick` and we can invoke the
function by calling `"changeColor()"`.

Paste this code into the opening tag of the button element:
`onclick="changeColor()"`.

**3.**

Let’s test out the functionality of the code that we just added. When
you click the “Repaint!” button, the background color of the site should
be reset at random!

When you’re ready, click **Run** again and move on to the next exercise.

### Solution

``` html
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">

  </head>

  <body>
      <button onclick="changeColor()">Repaint!</button>
  </body>
  
      <script>
        function getRandomColor(){
          let letters = '0123456789ABCDEF';
          let color = '#';
          for (let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
            color += letters[Math.floor(Math.random() * 16)];
          }
          return color;
        }
        function changeColor(){
          let newColor = getRandomColor();
          document.body.style.backgroundColor = newColor;
        }
    </script>
  
</html>
```

## What is SQL?

Now that Alejandra has built out the user-facing checkout features of
her website, she’s realized that she needs to store all of this
information somewhere! She needs her application to be able to store,
retrieve, and modify data like usernames, shipping addresses, payment
information, and more.

In order to build out these features, Alejandra needs to learn some
*SQL*, which stands for **s**tructured **q**uery **l**anguage. You might
be familiar with SQL as a language that Data Analysts and Data
Scientists use to query and analyze data.

SQL stores information in tables, which is simply a collection of
information organized into rows and columns. If you’ve worked with a
spreadsheet like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, you might be familiar
with working with tables. To get the information, you would write a
*query*, or a program that would retrieve data from the table.

Here’s an example of a query that would select all of the columns —the
`*` keyword is a shorthand for “all”— from the `page_views` table:

``` sql
SELECT * FROM page_views;
```

Web developers and software engineers also use SQL to build apps that
can save, modify, and access data. There’s even a growing field of *data
engineering*, which is a specialized subset of software engineers who
ensure that the applications they are working with accurately and
efficiently record all of the required data.

### Instructions

**1.**

Now you try it! Add `SELECT * FROM users;` to the text editor to select
the entire `users` table from the database.

Press run and take a look at the data that is returned. What kinds of
data is Alejandra’s app able to store and retrieve? Why is it important
for her to store this particular set of information?

### Solution

``` sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

## Review

Alejandra now has a fully functional web application for her small
business!

In building out the features that she needed for her business’s
application, she learned about the four languages that form the core of
the World Wide Web today:

- **HTML** — structures website content
- **CSS** — applies styling to websites
- **JavaScript** — adds interactivity to websites
- **SQL** — allows your web application to store and retrieve data

While these languages are each essential to web development, many of
them also have applications in other fields. For example, JavaScript was
initially just a language for interacting with HTML, but JavaScript has
expanded to be a general-purpose programming language that can be run
outside of the browser. You can now build web applications, browser
games, desktop applications, and even VR/AR experiences in JavaScript.

Learning web development has given Alejandra the skills that she needed
for her business and also opened the door for her to take on more and
more technical projects in a wide variety of fields.

# What is Programming?

Programming is a collaboration between humans and computers.

### PROGRAMMING IS EVERYWHERE

Programming is, quite literally, all around us. From the take-out we
order, to the movies we stream, code enables everyday actions in our
lives. Tech companies are no longer recognizable as just software
companies — instead, they bring food to our door, help us get a taxi,
influence outcomes in presidential elections, or act as a personal
trainer.

</iframe>

### …AND PROGRAMMING IS FOR EVERYONE

For many years, only a few people have known how to code. However,
that’s starting to change. The number of people learning to code is
increasing year by year, with estimates around
<a href="https://www.developernation.net/developer-reports/dn22"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">31.1 million software developers
worldwide</a>, which doesn’t even account for the many OTHER careers
that relate to programming.

Here at Codecademy, our mission is to make technical knowledge
accessible and applicable. Technology plays a crucial role in our
economy — but programming is no longer just for software engineers. Any
person can benefit from learning to program — whether it’s learning HTML
to improve your marketing emails or taking a SQL course to add a dose of
analysis to your research role.

Even outside of the tech industry, learning to program is essential to
participating in the world around you: it affects the products you buy,
the legal policies you vote for, and the data you share online.

So, let’s dig into what programming is.

### WHAT IS PROGRAMMING?

Put simply, programming is giving a set of instructions to a computer to
execute. If you’ve ever cooked using a recipe before, you can think of
yourself as the computer and the recipe’s author as a programmer. The
recipe author provides you with a set of instructions which you read and
then follow. The more complex the instructions, the more complex the
result!

*How good are you at giving instructions? Try and get Codey to draw a
square!*

### PROGRAMMING AS COMMUNICATION, or CODING

“Ok, so now I know what programming is, but what’s coding? I’m here to
learn how to code. Are they the same thing?”

While sometimes used interchangeably, programming and coding actually
have different definitions.

- *Programming* is the mental process of thinking up instructions to
  give to a machine (like a computer).
- *Coding* is the process of transforming those ideas into a written
  language that a computer can understand.

Over the past century, humans have been trying to figure out how to best
communicate with computers through different <a
href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/programming-languages/"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank">programming languages</a>. Programming has evolved from
punch cards with rows of numbers that a machine read, to drag-and-drop
interfaces that increase programming speed, with lots of other methods
in between.

To this day, people are still developing programming languages, trying
to improve our programming efficiency. Others are building new languages
that improve accessibility to learning to code, like

### PROGRAMMING AS COLLABORATION

> “The problem with programming is not that the computer isn’t
> logical—the computer is terribly logical, relentlessly
> literal-minded.”

Ellen Ullman, *Life in Code*

When we give instructions to a computer through code, we are, in our own
way, communicating with the computer. But since computers are built
differently than we are, we have to translate our instructions in a way
that computers will understand.

Computers interpret instructions in a very literal manner, so we have to
be very specific in how we program them. Think about instructing someone
to walk. If you start by telling them, “Put your foot in front of
yourself,” do they know what a foot is? Or what front means? (and now we
understand why it’s taken so long to develop bipedal robots…). In
coding, that could mean making sure that small things like punctuation
and spelling are correct. Many tears have been shed over a missing
semicolon (`;`) a symbol that a lot of programming languages use to
denote the end of a line.

But rather than think of this as a boss-employee relationship, it’s more
helpful to think about our relationship with computers as a
collaboration.

The computer is just one (particularly powerful) tool in a long list of
tools that humans have used to extend and augment their ability.

As mentioned before, computers are very good at certain things and well,
not so good at others. But here’s the good news: the things that
computers are good at, humans suck at, and the things that computers
suck at, humans are good at! Take a look at this handy table:

src="https://content.codecademy.com/programs/code-foundations-path/bop-i/human_computer.png"
class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp"
alt="table comparing human and computer abilities" />

Just imagine what we can accomplish when we work together! We can make
movies with incredible special effects, have continuous 24/7 factory
production, and improve our cities and health.

target="_blank" rel="noopener">via GIPHY</a>

*The best computer programs are the ones that enable us to make things
that we couldn’t do on our own, but leverage our creative capacities. We
may be good at drawing, but a computer is great at doing the same task
repeatedly — and quickly!*

### CONCLUSION

As programming becomes a larger part of our lives, it’s vital that
everyone has an understanding of what programming is and how it can be
used. Programming is important to our careers, but it also plays a key
role in how we participate in politics, how we buy things, and how we
stay in touch with one another.

Learning to code is an exciting journey. Whether your goal is to build a
mobile app, search a database, or program a robot, coding is a skill
that will take you far in life. Just remember — computers are tools.
While learning to program may initially be frustrating, if you choose to
stick with it, you’ll be able to make some brilliant things.
