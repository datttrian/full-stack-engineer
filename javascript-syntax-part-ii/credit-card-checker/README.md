# Challenge Project: Credit Card Checker

#### Overview

This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus
far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project
contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project
you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill
all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet,
Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you
cannot easily solve.

#### Project Goals

Context: The company that you work for suspects that credit card
distributors have been mailing out cards that have invalid numbers. In
this project, you have the role of a clerk who checks if credit cards
are valid. Every other clerk currently checks using pencil and paper,
but you’ll be optimizing the verification process using your knowledge
of functions and loops to handle multiple credit cards at a time. Unlike
the other clerks, you can spend the rest of your time relaxing!

As you progress through the steps, use the terminal and `console.log()`
statements to check the output of your loops and functions.

#### Setup Instructions

If you choose to do this project on your computer instead of Codecademy,
you can download what you’ll need by clicking the “Download” button
below. You’ll need to open and work in **main.js** in a text editor. To
edit **main.js**, use your text editor of choice. If you need a
recommendation or help to install an editor, we recommend looking into
our <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/articles/visual-studio-code"

target="_blank">article about setting up a text editor for web
development</a> (Follow along until you get to the section: “Practice:
Let’s Make a Project”). To run **main.js** on your computer, you will
need to install Node.js. If you need help installing Node.js, read our

## Prerequisites

1\.

In order to complete this project, you should have completed the first
few sections of
<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank">Introduction to JavaScript</a> (through Learn
JavaScript: Loops).

## Project Requirements

2\.

Look over the starter code. There are 15 arrays that each contain the
digits of separate credit card numbers. They all have prefixes to
reflect their status, i.e. variables that start with `valid` contain a
valid number, whereas `invalid` do not, and `mystery` variables can be
either. There is also a `batch` array that stores all of the provided
credit cards in a single array.

You’ll use these arrays later to check if your functions are working
properly.

3\.

Create a function, `validateCred()` that has a parameter of an array.
The purpose of `validateCred()` is to return `true` when an array
contains digits of a valid credit card number and `false` when it is
invalid. This function should NOT mutate the values of the original
array.

To find out if a credit card number is valid or not, use the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm#Description"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luhn algorithm</a>. Generally speaking,
an algorithm is a series of steps that solve a problem — the Luhn
algorithm is a series of mathematical calculations used to validate
certain identification numbers, e.g. credit card numbers. The
calculations in the Luhn algorithm can be broken down as the following
steps:

1.  Starting from the farthest digit to the right, AKA the check digit,
    iterate to the left.
2.  As you iterate to the left, every other digit is doubled (the check
    digit is not doubled). If the number is greater than `9` after
    doubling, subtract `9` from its value.
3.  Sum up all the digits in the credit card number.
4.  If the sum modulo `10` is `0` (if the sum divided by `10` has a
    remainder of `0`) then the number is valid, otherwise, it’s invalid.

Here’s a <a
href="https://content.codecademy.com/PRO/independent-practice-projects/credit-card-checker/diagrams/cc%20validator%20diagram%201.svg"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">visual that outlines the steps</a>. Check
your function using both the provided valid and invalid numbers.

4\.

Create another function, `findInvalidCards()` that has one parameter for
a nested array of credit card numbers. The role of `findInvalidCards()`
is to check through the nested array for which numbers are invalid, and
return another nested array of invalid cards.

5\.

After finding all the invalid credit card numbers, it’s also necessary
to identify the credit card companies that have possibly issued these
faulty numbers. Create a function, `idInvalidCardCompanies()` that has
one parameter for a nested array of invalid numbers and returns an array
of companies.

Currently, there 4 accepted companies which each have unique first
digits. The following table shows which digit is unique to which
company:

| First Digit | Company                 |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| 3           | Amex (American Express) |
| 4           | Visa                    |
| 5           | Mastercard              |
| 6           | Discover                |

If the number doesn’t start with any of the numbers listed, print out a
message like: “Company not found”.

`idInvalidCardCompanies()` should return an array of companies that have
mailed out cards with invalid numbers. This array should NOT contain
duplicates, i.e. even if there are two invalid Visa cards, `"Visa"`
should only appear once in the array.

our sample solution code. You can also learn how to host your own
solution on GitHub so you can share it with other learners! Your
solution might look different from ours, and that’s okay! There are
multiple ways to solve these projects, and you’ll learn more by seeing
others’ code.

7\.

If you’d like to challenge yourself further, you could consider the
following:

- Use different credit card numbers from <a
  href="https://www.freeformatter.com/credit-card-number-generator-validator.html"
  class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">a credit card number generator and
  validator site</a> and test if your functions work for all types of
  credit cards.
- To make it easier to test credit card numbers, create a function that
  accepts a string and converts it into an array of numbers like the
  initially provided arrays. (Check the hint for a helpful function)
- Create a function that will convert invalid numbers into valid
  numbers.
